# Crafting_Interpreters

This is a follow-along repo for the book `"Crafting Interpreters"` by `Robert Nystrom`

I will be implementing `jlox` and `clox`, trying to understand the structure of the languange and various other aspects.

My goal eventually is to have a better understanding of Open Source Language codebases and being able to contribute. (e.g. Swift, CPython, etc.) Also, I'm curious to know how programming languages actually work under the hood, and try to implement my own language in c++.
