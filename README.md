# Crafting_Interpreters

This is an follow-along repo for the book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom

I will be implementing jlox and clox, trying to understand the structure of the languange and various other aspects.

My goal eventually is to have a better understanding of Open Source Language codebases and being able to contribute. (e.g. Swift, CPython, etc.)
